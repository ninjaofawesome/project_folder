<strong> The CSS Box Model <strong>

<p> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. </p>

<p> The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. </p>

<p> The box model allows us to place a border around elements and space elements in relation to other elements </p>

<strong> Padding <strong> 

<p> The padding clears an area around the content (inside the border) of an element. The padding is affected by the background color of the element. </p>

 <p> The top, right, bottom, and left padding can be changed independently using separate properties. A shorthand padding property can also be used, to change all paddings at once. </p>

 <p> <strong> Margins <strong> </p>

 <p> The CSS margin properties define the space around elements. </p>

 <p> The margin clears an area around an element (outside the border). The margin does not have a background color, and is completely transparent. </p>

<p> The top, right, bottom, and left margin can be changed independently using separate properties. A shorthand margin property can also be used, to change all margins at once. </p>
