Building a Team Website

On the first day of Flatiron School Brooklyn we took two hours to make an HTML static website for our team of three members.
Our website includes a header for our team name "Arrows For Sparrows," three links to our blogs and biographies on a sidebar, and our team blog on the mainpage.
