Adding content

This text is in the &lt<body>&gt of the HTML. This is where we want to publish the majority of our content.  We want to tell people all about sparrows--how to identify them, how to avoid them, how to defeat them.
Using a block quote, we highlight quotes from reputable sources on sparrows:
&lt<blockquote>&gt"Sparrows cause global warming by radiating evil. This is a known fact, because it is a fact and I know it."  - Dr. Stephen Hawking&lt</blockquote>&gt

	&lt<blockquote>&gt"Lies!" - Sparrows
If we want to include a link other sparrow-related resources, we can use the <a href:> tag, like so.&lt</blockquote>&gt
