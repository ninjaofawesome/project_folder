<h1> CSS Selector Statements <h1>

<p> A CSS rule has two main parts: a selector, and one or more declarations: </p>

<p> The selector is normally the HTML element you want to style. </p>

<p> Each declaration consists of a property and a value. </p>

<p> The property is the style attribute you want to change. Each property has a value. </p>

<p> A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration groups are surrounded by curly brackets </p>

<b> Example: </b>

<p> p {color:red;text-align:center;} </p>
