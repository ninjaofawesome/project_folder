<h3>Making lists</h3>
You can make lists of lists, links, links to lists--anyway you want it.<br>
Sparrows eat:
<ul>
<li> insects </li>
<li> seeds </li>
<li> souls </li>
</ul><br>
A basic unordered list can be created using the  &lt ul &gt and &lt li &gt tags: <br>
&lt ul &gt <br>
&lt li &gt Here's a list item. &lt li &gt <br>
&lt li &gt And another! &lt li &gt <br>
&lt li &gt Lists are awesome. li &gt <br>
