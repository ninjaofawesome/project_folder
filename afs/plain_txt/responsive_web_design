Responsive web design centers on a flexible grid and flexible images that provides an optimal viewing experience on any browser.

Want to get up and running with responsive design faster?  There are frameworks which take out quite a bit of frustration for people new to responsive design.  Two of the more popular frameworks available today are <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> (we recommend version 3 over 4) and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.  Although there are many to choose from, both Foundation and Bootstrap are used by countless websites and have great documentation to make it easy to go from static to fluid in no time flat.
