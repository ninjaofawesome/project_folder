To note, this is an example of how I have a hard time "grasping" this.  I read over the instructions and figured out how to MANUALLY put everything into hashes, but I completely did not see that the assignment was to create a way to MAKE those hashes.  I copied over Blake's instructions as I would have been struggling with this and added comments, but will have to go over nesting again.  Reposting!
